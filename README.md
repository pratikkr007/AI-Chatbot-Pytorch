# AI-Chatbot-Pytorch

Developed a conversational AI chatbot using PyTorch to classify user intents and generate appropriate responses.

Tools & Technologies Used: Python, PyTorch, NLTK, JSON, Neural Networks
Designed a 3-layer feedforward neural network with ReLU activation and dropout for intent classification.
Implemented tokenization, lemmatization, and a bag-of-words model for text preprocessing.
Built a modular architecture with function mappings to dynamically handle tasks like fetching stock data.
Trained the model using CrossEntropyLoss and optimized it with Adam optimizer, achieving efficient convergence.
Integrated real-time conversation flow using Pythonâ€™s DataLoader for batch processing and streamlined user input handling.
